# Thumper Wiki Source
This repo contains the sources for the Thumper Wiki. The wiki is almost entirely written in just markdown. Using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) as a static site generator. If you want to contribute, fork the repo and submit a pr.

The built html content is not in this repo but hosted privatly and is updated when new commits are made to the source.

If you have mdbook installed you can run `mdbook serve` to run a live version the wiki with your the cloned repo.
