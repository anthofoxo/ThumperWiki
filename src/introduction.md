# How This Wiki is Structured

## Concepts
These topics give an overview of game file structures and explain key concepts that aid the understanding of the game file formats and object formats.

## Data Types
An object or a game file is specified by a sequence of bytes. These bytes are grouped separately to form values, each of a particular data type. Known data types used in the game files, such as [bool](data_types.md#bool) and [int32](data_types.md#int32), are listed here.

## Trait Values
Trait values are a list of options available for a trait or parameter of an object. In [Drool's Editor](drools_editor.md), these values are displayed in a drop-down list.

## Magic Numbers
A magic number is a 32-bit hash value produced by applying a hash function on a string. Different types of magic numbers used in the game files are listed here.

## Objects
The definition and general format of each type of object are explained here.

## Game Files
Each game file is documented here, detailing each value, its data type and its meaning.
